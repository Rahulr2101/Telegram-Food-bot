Telegram bot is designed to conduct polls on various topics and gather responses from users. It provides a platform for engaging with a community or group of users and collecting their opinions.

<h2>Feature</h2>
<h4>Command Handlers</h4>
The bot defines several command handlers to respond to specific user commands. These commands can be initiated by users in a Telegram chat or private conversation.

<h4>Poll Creation</h4> 
The bot allows users to create polls by specifying a question or topic and a list of options. The poll can be customized with additional settings, such as anonymity, multiple-choice options, or restrictions on who can participate.

<h4>Additional Functionality</h4>
Depending on the specific implementation, the bot may offer additional features like scheduling polls, setting reminders, integrating with external APIs or services, providing data visualization for poll results, or allowing users to share polls with others.
